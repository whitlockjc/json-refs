* Added support to work with URI encoded JSON References and to handle JSON References with unescaped special
characters *(This means that if you have a reference like `#/paths/{petId}`, which is technically invalid, we will not
mark it as invalid and will process it.  It also means if your reference is escaped, like `#/definitions/My%20Pet`, it
will also work as expected.)* *(Issue #61)*

like objects that fail validation so that you can identify invalid JSON References easier *(See API documentation for details)*
* Updated `#isPtr` to validate the `$ref` value is a URI instead of treating all string values as valid
* Updated `#isPtr` to validate the [tokens](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901#section-4) *(Issue #47)*

Pointer values *(The `Error` would have the details as to why the provided value is not a JSON Pointer)* *(Issue #47)*

Reference values *(The `Error` would have the details as to why the provided value is not a JSON Reference)* *(Issue #47)*
